idf

first 16 bytes:
file starts with an int32 indicating idf version (e.g. 8 or 9)
bytes5-8 are a time_t (4 bytes) indicating recording time. unix_time= readasint32(data); unix_epoch = datenum(1970,1,1,0,0,0); timestr = datestr(unix_time./86400 + unix_epoch);
int32 indicating horizontal resolution
int32 indicating verstical resolution (screen)





Can't figure out the header for the computer name or for the data column indicator
But can read column indicator by simply looking for "Timestamp", always start with that in the files i've seen




every sample start with 53 00 00 00 00 or 53 03 00 00 00 in hex
every message starts with 4D 00 00 00 00, then timestamp (32bit signed int), then int8 how many characters, then text, then 01 00 00 00

version 9 has subject name and description at end of idf file


between end of data format and start of data, there is always this:
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000100000004000000000000000000F03F

Between start of Timestamp and end of computer name is always a fixed amount of space:

right before Timestamp is length of string as uint8

computer name, length indicator, os version, length indicator, iview version

right before computer name, there is this:
D00700009E0200007C0100002C010000000F
8D2000007F020000DA010000280100000008
A00F0000 BC020000 DA010000 29010000 00 14
if v8 (doesn't have computer name), same just before data format spec:
200300009E020000790100002C010000004C
These contain:
int32 fs (1/fs*1000*1000, e.g. 800 for 1250 recordings)
int32 head distance
int32 stim dim x
int32 stim dim y
uint8 00
length indicator of computer name
